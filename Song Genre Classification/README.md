# Classify-Song-Genres-from-Audio-Data

## Project Description

In this project, you will use a dataset containing songs from two genres (Hip-Hop and Rock) to train a classifier that can distinguish between them based on track information from Echonest (now part of Spotify). You will start by using the pandas and seaborn libraries in Python to subset the data, aggregate information, and create visualizations to explore any trends or factors that may be relevant for machine learning.

Then, you will use scikit-learn to build a model that can predict a songâ€™s genre based on features such as danceability, energy, acousticness, and tempo. You will experiment with common algorithms like PCA, logistic regression, and decision trees to find the best approach.
